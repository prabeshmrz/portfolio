Hey, My name is Prabesh Maharjan. I am a backend engineer, dev/ops engineer, full-stack developer, and linux enthusiast.

Being from BIM (Bachelors in Information Management) background has helped me to adapt to both the development and management side of the thing. I have experienced the development through agile methodology like SCRUM.

My objective is to provide effective, efficient, and adaptive software solutions through my knowledge and skills. I am dedicated to keeping on learning new things to come up with better solutions.

My expertise includes backend development and dev/ops, and also interested in data analysis and machine learning.
